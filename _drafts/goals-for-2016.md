tags: goal, consistency, new year, challenge

Following up on my most recent post reviewing the past year, I wanted to set
some new goals for this upcoming year. You can see my goals for 2015
[here](http://pcockwell.github.io/blog/2015/01/07/goal-setting-and-consistency.html)
and a look back on how I did for those goals
[here](http://pcockwell.github.io/blog/2016/01/01/reviewing-the-past-year.html).
Similar to the structure that I used last year, I'll be detailing some targets
I'll be trying to reach in three different categories:

> Goal – Something I want to accomplish that is measurable and relatively
> continual. eg. exercise X times per week or decrease sugar consumption by X
> percent. These are often habits I want to build into my life an my hope is
> that by doing it for a year, it will stick.
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Theme – A central topic for the year – something I can spend time thinking
> about and take a few concrete efforts towards. eg. build community or rethink
> what health means. These are often abstract ideas that are hard to measure
> but important to spend time focusing on.
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Challenge – Something I want to conquer. Crossing an item off my bucket list.
> eg. climb Mr. Everest or learn to tight rope walk. These are binary, I either
> complete them or I don’t.

### 2016 Goal: Become Conversational in German

I had a few issues learning some languages in the past year. One was that I
tried to take on too much with the task. This year, I'm limiting the breadth
and going to be increasing the depth of this goal. I want to not just be able
to read an article in German on a regular basis, I want to be fully
conversational in German. I'm also going to tack on French to this if/when I
feel I am strong with my German as I've already got a base in French.

Another issue I faced with this challenge last year was consistency. I plan on
having this be something I do first thing in the morning rather than at will,
or in the evening. Doing this in the evening opens it up to being too tired to
follow through, which is something I want to avoid. Futhermore, as a reward and
purpose to learning German, I am committing now to go to Germany and Austria
(among other locations) by the end of January 2017. I might go earlier if I
learn the language and become conversational earlier, but the deadline and
target is January of next year.

As with last year, I'm going to be using
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)'s mobile and web applications to learn
German. If you'd like to challenge yourself (and me), you can sign up
[here](https://www.duolingo.com/register) and follow my progress
[here](https://www.duolingo.com/pcockwell). Furthermore, as a supplemental way
to increase my exposure and learn more, I will be looking into a penpal that I
can converse with, and hopefully my roommate and I will be opening our doors to
couchsurfers this year. If you are interested in staying with us, please see
our profile on [CourchSurfing](couchsurfing.com/people/patrick-cockwell) and
feel free to send us a request to stay with us.
