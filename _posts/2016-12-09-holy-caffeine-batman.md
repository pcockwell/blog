So I've been having issues with focusing lately. I find myself distracted
easily, and unable to string together significant productivity. It was
suggested that I try getting myself some caffeinated tea, brew it for a
consistent amount of time, measure out a specific amount of tea, and then see
if it affects my focus and productivity. I was told to do this in this way so
that the effects and results can be controlled and measured, and to see if the
effect is consistent throughout the day.

I tried this for the first time today, and WOAH! Being someone who has never
been a coffee drinker, and who rarely if ever drinks tea, I can definitely
notice results. Obviously, this is what caffeine is intended to do, but it is a
world of difference to someone who simply normally doesn't have large amounts
of caffeine in their diet.

I plan on continuing this experiment further next week to see if this change
and focus remains consistent, but thus far, I am quite happy with the results.
The world of caffeine and its benefits has been revealed to me. Though I will
admit to a level of worry about dependency and the quantity that I may be
consuming...
