I was going to use this post as my first update to last week, but something very difficult has happened in the past week. As a result, today's post is going to be about that subject. And that subject is depression and suicide.

This past week, someone I knew, respected, and looked up to took their own life. Throughout my life, this is the third person with whom I've had significant contact, and whom I considered a friend that has done so.

Rather than go into specifics, I will try and address the topic as a whole. Depression is not a myth, and it is not a trivial issue to deal with. It is also not a permanent issue. Suicide is permanent solution to a temporary problem. I won't claim to understand the pain of depression because I haven't experienced it, but I will plead with anyone experiencing it to talk to someone. There are many resources available to help, and I ask that you use them. I've posted links to some resourcesat the bottom of this post. It might be the conversation that turns things around for you.

Whether you may believe it or not, you need to understand that there are people out there that love and care about you. I may or may not know you, but I care about you. I want you to feel better. I want you to get better.

In memory of those who are no longer with us, I will be donating to [SF Suicide Prevention](http://www.sfsuicide.org/onlinedonation/), and ask that you do so as well if you able to, and if not, please just post something on social media, and raise awareness and share resources about suicide prevention and help with depression. This is a serious topic that affects many people and needs to be properly addressed.

Here are some resources you can use to talk to someone if you are in need:

* [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)
* [Suicide.org Hotlines](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-hotlines.html)
* [Canada Suicide Hotlines](http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/canada-suicide-hotlines.html)
* [Suicide Prevention Crisis Chat Line](http://www.didihirsch.org/chat)
